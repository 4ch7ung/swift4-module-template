# swift-package
This recipe explains exactly how to set up a great Swift package for modular reuse. It also includes a configurator that asks you a few questions and gives you a fully-functional Swift module to start with.

This project is opinionated. You get some extra stuff that I think all Swift packages should have.

## Your Module Will Have
-   Ability to be used from Swift Package Manager, CocoaPods and Carthage
-   Clean folder structure
-   MIT license
-   Testing as a standard
-   Turnkey access to Travis CI
-   Semantic versioning and a CHANGELOG

## How to Use This

Clone or [download a release](https://github.com/fulldecent/swift-package/releases) and run the  `./configure` program.

It will then ask you some questions and create your project for you. You then add more interesting features to the module and example program.

## Contributing

See the file `Recipe.md` for the complete steps (e.g. Open Xcode, make new project, click here, type that, ...) of how we made the template.
